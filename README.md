Javascript basics are covered in this repo. I'm a beginner in this.
I want to make sure that the fellow beginners won't face much problem in looking up for code snippets or examples.
So, I have made this and this is purely based on the Crash Course Video from FreeCodeCamp on Youtube.
You can have the video playing on one tab and this file on the other so that you'll be sure with the examples.
I tried to type and explain all the stuff that was provided during the CrashCourse Video.
I'll be improving this for sure once I get into a good position in JavaScript.
Do open a PR with any updates and submit the issues if any.
Make sure you star this repo :D
